            <p>Hi, I am Tue ~ you pronounce it exactly how you would say TUEsday :)</p>
            <p>Something interesting about me? I was actually born on Tuesday as well but that is not why I was named Tue though. So a pretty cool coincidence!!</p>
            <p>
                I am a full stack web developer, focusing on Angular 2+ and ASP .NET Core Framework. 
                On the cloud, I have experience with designing and implementing systems on AWS (Amazon Web Service) platform. 
                I also have a strong understanding of continuous integration and continuous deployment concept.
